Customer Churn Analysis – Project Overview

This project explores customer churn patterns using a combination of demographic, subscription, and usage-related features. The goal is to understand what factors contribute most to customer churn and to highlight actionable insights through clear visualizations.

The analysis includes:

✔️ Churn Distribution

A breakdown of churned vs. non-churned customers to understand the overall churn rate.

✔️ Gender-wise Churn Comparison

Examines churn behavior across male and female customers to identify any gender-based patterns.

✔️ Senior Citizen Impact

Analyzes whether senior citizens are more likely to churn compared to younger customers.

✔️ Payment Method Influence

Studies churn rates across different payment methods such as credit card, bank transfer, and electronic checks.

✔️ Contract Type vs Churn

Shows how churn varies between month-to-month, one-year, and two-year contracts.
Month-to-month customers typically show much higher churn, making contract type one of the strongest indicators.

✔️ Tenure Distribution

Highlights how long customers stay before they churn, helping identify early-risk segments.

Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Pandas for data handling

Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualizations

Key Insights

Churn is significantly higher among month-to-month contract customers.

Electronic check users also show a comparatively higher churn rate.

Longer-tenure customers tend to remain loyal.

Senior citizens show slightly different churn behavior, requiring focused retention strategies.
