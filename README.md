Customer Churn Analysis – Project Overview

This project explores customer churn patterns using a combination of demographic, subscription, and usage-related features. The goal is to understand what factors contribute most to customer churn and to highlight actionable insights through clear visualizations.

Churn Distribution
A breakdown of churned vs. non-churned customers to understand the overall churn rate.

Gender-wise Churn Comparison
Examines churn behavior across male and female customers to identify any gender-based patterns.

Senior Citizen Impact
Analyzes whether senior citizens are more likely to churn compared to younger customers.

Payment Method Influence
Studies churn rates across different payment methods such as credit card, bank transfer, and electronic checks.

Contract Type vs Churn
Shows how churn varies between month-to-month, one-year, and two-year contracts.
Month-to-month customers typically show much higher churn, making contract type one of the strongest indicators.

Tenure Distribution
Highlights how long customers stay before they churn, helping identify early-risk segments.

Tools Used
Python
Pandas for data handling
Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualizations
Jupyter Notebook for analysis workflow
