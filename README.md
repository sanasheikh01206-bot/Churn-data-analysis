**Customer Churn Analysis — Project Overview**

This project analyzes customer churn patterns using demographic, subscription, and usage-related features. The objective is to identify the key factors influencing churn and present actionable insights through clear, data-driven visualizations.

**Key Analysis Components**

***1. Churn Distribution***

Provides an overall view of churned vs. non-churned customers, helping establish the baseline churn rate.

***2. Gender-wise Churn Comparison***

Evaluates churn patterns between male and female customers to identify any noticeable differences.

***6. Tenure Distribution***

Highlights how long customers stay before they churn, helping identify early-risk customer segments.
